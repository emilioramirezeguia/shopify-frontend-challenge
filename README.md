# Shopify Frontend Challenge

This project was made as part of the Shopify [Front-End Developer Internship](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ni/Shopify/ee14b4f1-62ec-4a47-850b-2311c57f855b-front-end-developer-intern-remote-summer-2021) for Summer 2021.

## Challenge

The challenge was to create a webpage that could search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favorite films to a list. Once they had selected 5 movies, they should be notified they're finished.

## Technical Requirements

1. Search results should come from OMDB's free API.
2. Each search result should list at least its title, year of release, and a button to nominate that film.
3. Updates to the search terms should update the result list.
4. Movies in search results can be added and removed from the saved list.
5. If a search result has already been saved, disable its save button.
6. Display a banner when the user has 5 saved movies.
